# üîë SEO Keyword Clustering Tool

A cost-effective desktop application built with Python and Streamlit for advanced SEO keyword analysis and organization. This tool leverages the DataForSEO API and features a robust local caching system to minimize API costs and build a proprietary dataset over time.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Cost-Effective Data Fetching:** Fetches SERP results, Search Volume, CPC, Keyword Difficulty, and Search Intent from the DataForSEO API.
- **Intelligent Local Caching:** A built-in SQLite database caches all API responses. The tool checks the cache before every API call, preventing redundant requests and saving significant costs.
- **Advanced SERP Clustering:** Three clustering algorithms (Default, Strict, Balanced Strict) with two cluster strategies (Search Volume vs CPC) for optimal keyword grouping based on overlapping SERP URLs.
- **Cache Control:** User-configurable cache duration lets you decide when to fetch fresh data vs. use existing local data.
- **Data Analysis & Export:** An interactive workbench to analyze, filter, and summarize cluster data. Final reports can be exported to a multi-sheet Excel file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **GUI Framework:** Streamlit
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
- **Database:** SQLite
- **API Communication:** Requests

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FassihFayyaz/SEO-Clustering-Tool.git
    cd SEO-Clustering-Tool
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Credentials**
    -   Create a file at `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.
    -   Add your DataForSEO credentials in the following format:
        ```toml
        [dataforseo]
        api_login = "YOUR_DATAFORSEO_EMAIL"
        api_password = "YOUR_DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD"
        ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application will open in your web browser.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Future Features

This project is actively being developed. The following features and improvements are planned for future releases. We encourage contributions! Please open an issue to discuss any ideas.

- [x] **Add Intersection Count:** Add a column to the cluster results table showing the number of overlapping URLs between a keyword and its cluster's main keyword.
- [x] **Improve Cluster Summary UI:** Rework the "Data Analysis" tab to display the cluster summary as a header row directly above the detailed keywords for each cluster, creating a more intuitive, hierarchical view.
- [x] **Optimize API Calls:** Implement true bulk requests for asynchronous tasks to significantly speed up the data fetching process for large keyword lists.
- [x] **Enhanced Clustering Algorithms:** Implement three clustering algorithms (Default, Strict, Balanced Strict) with two cluster strategies (Volume vs CPC) for optimal keyword grouping.
- [ ] **Implement User Login:** Add a secure login system to manage multiple users or projects.
- [ ] **Develop "Local Clustering" (Tab 2):** Implement the placeholder tab to allow users to apply their own local machine-learning models for semantic clustering.
