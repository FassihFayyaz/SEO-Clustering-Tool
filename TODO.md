### Medium Priority
- [x] **Optimize API Calls with Bulk Requests:** Refactor the data fetcher to use true bulk `task_post` calls for SERP and Volume APIs to increase speed.
- [ ] **Refine Clustering Algorithm:** Experiment with different thresholds and logic in the clustering algorithm to improve group relevance.

### Low Priority / Future Features
- [ ] **Implement User Login:** Add a secure authentication system.
- [ ] **Develop "Local Clustering" (Tab 2):** Implement the functionality for users to apply their own local ML models for clustering.
