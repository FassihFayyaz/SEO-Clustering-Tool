# Semantic Clustering Dependencies - CPU Only
#
# This file installs semantic clustering dependencies for CPU-only processing
# Perfect for users who want to avoid large GPU dependencies
#
# IMPORTANT: Install PyTorch CPU version FIRST, then this file!
#
# Step 1: Install PyTorch CPU-only version
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#
# Step 2: Install this requirements file
# pip install -r requirements-semantic-cpu.txt
#
# Hardware Requirements:
# - CPU: Any modern processor
# - RAM: 4GB+ (8GB+ recommended for large keyword lists)
# - Storage: ~500MB for dependencies + 2-10GB for models
#
# Performance:
# - Speed: Baseline performance, works everywhere
# - Models: All models supported, larger models need more RAM
# - Compatibility: Universal - works on any system

# Total Download Size: ~500MB (much smaller than GPU versions)
# 
# Supported Models:
# ✅ gte-large (recommended for CPU)
# ✅ bge-large-en-v1.5 (recommended for CPU)
# ✅ sentence-t5-xl (needs 8GB+ RAM)
# ✅ Qwen-0.6B (needs 6GB+ RAM)
# ⚠️ Qwen-4B (needs 16GB+ RAM)
# ❌ Qwen-8B (too large for most CPU setups)
#
# Performance Tips:
# - Use gte-large or bge-large for best CPU performance
# - Close other applications to free up RAM
# - Process large keyword lists in smaller batches
# - Consider upgrading to 16GB+ RAM for better performance
